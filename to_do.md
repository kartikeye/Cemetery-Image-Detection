# Cemetery Image Detection Project - Progress

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. ✅ Data Collection
- ✅ Take photos from internet, of cemetery and normal with the link provided in teams by chacha
- ✅ Have 2 cemetery satellite images: `cemetry_image_1.png` and `cemetry_image_2.png`

### 2. ✅ Traditional Computer Vision Analysis (COMPLETED!)
- ✅ Built complete computer vision system using traditional CV + feature analysis
- ✅ Implemented 6 different feature detection methods:
  - Regular grid pattern detection
  - Texture uniformity analysis
  - Line regularity using Hough transforms
  - Rectangular structure detection
  - Color pattern analysis (vegetation)
  - Feature visualization system

### 3. ✅ Analysis Results
- ✅ **RESULT:** `cemetry_image_2.png` is more likely a cemetery (Score: 0.5075)
- ✅ **CONFIDENCE:** 19.2% higher than image 1
- ✅ Generated detailed analysis visualizations
- ✅ Both images show medium cemetery likelihood (0.3-0.6 range)

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS (AI Development Phase)

### Phase 2: Deep Learning Model Development (PLANNED)
**Goal:** Develop AI model to detect cemeteries with 85-90% accuracy
