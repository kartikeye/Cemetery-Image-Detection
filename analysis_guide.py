GUIDE: How to Analyze Your New Cemetery Satellite Images

Your attached images show EXCELLENT cemetery characteristics:
✅ Clear rectangular burial plots arranged in organized rows
✅ Well-defined pathways between sections  
✅ Uniform spacing and grid-like layout
✅ Mixed vegetation and paved areas
✅ Perfect examples for computer vision analysis!

These images should score MUCH higher than your previous ones.
